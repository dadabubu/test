                    game.

                  <div class="text-gray-600 px-4 pb-4">
                    Yes, Absurdle is generally considered more challenging than regular Wordle. The game's adversarial nature means it actively works
                    against you by changing the target word based on your guesses. While Wordle maintains a fixed solution, Absurdle adapts to make
                    the game as long as possible.

                  <div class="text-gray-600 px-4 pb-4">
                    Popular starting words include:
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2">
                      <li>AUDIO (covers many common vowels)</li>
                      <li>RAISE (good vowel and consonant mix)</li>
                      <li>STARE (common letters in English)</li>
                      <li>CRANE (recommended by some statistical analyses)</li>
                    </ul>
                    However, because of Absurdle's adversarial nature, the "best" first word might not be as crucial as in regular Wordle.

                  <div class="text-gray-600 px-4 pb-4">
                    Absurdle uses the same color-coding system as Wordle:
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2">
                      <li>🟩 Green: Letter is in the correct position</li>

                      <li>⬜ Gray: Letter is not in the word</li>
                    </ul>
                    However, remember that these colors reflect the game's current word pool rather than a fixed solution.

                  <div class="text-gray-600 px-4 pb-4">
                    The game only accepts valid five-letter words from its dictionary. If you enter an invalid word:

                      <li>The guess won't count towards your attempts</li>

                  <div class="text-gray-600 px-4 pb-4">
                    Yes! Like Wordle, you can share your Absurdle results. The share feature will show:

                    While Absurdle itself is a variation of Wordle, it maintains consistent rules:
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2">
                      <li>Always uses 5-letter words</li>

                      <li>Can be played unlimited times</li>
                    </ul>
                    The challenge comes from the game's unique adversarial nature rather than different modes.
